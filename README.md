- **AMIs (Amazon Machine Images):** These are preconfigured templates for your EC2 instances. You can use existing AMIs or create custom ones.
- **Security Groups:** Think of these as virtual firewalls. They control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances.
- **Elastic IP Addresses:** These are static IPv4 addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. You can associate them with your EC2 instances.

### **2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

Amazon S3 is an object storage service with scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Key concepts include:

- **Buckets:** These are containers for storing objects (files) in S3. Each bucket has a globally unique name.
- **Objects:** Objects are the files stored in S3. They consist of data and metadata.
- **Access Control:** You can manage access permissions using Bucket Policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs).
- **Versioning:** S3 allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.

### **3. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. Important concepts include:
