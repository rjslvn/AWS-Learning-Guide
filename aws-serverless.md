**Lambda Primer**

* **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS):**  Run your code without managing servers. Pay per execution and scale automatically.
* **Event Triggers:**  Lambda functions respond to events:
    * API Gateway requests
    * S3 object uploads
    * DynamoDB updates
    * Scheduled events (via CloudWatch Events) 
* **Supported Runtimes:** Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, Go, and more. You can also bring custom runtimes.
* **Understanding Cold Starts:**  The initial execution of a function may have added latency, a consideration for time-sensitive applications.

**API Gateway Basics**

* **Frontend for Serverless:**  Create RESTful APIs to interact with Lambda or other AWS services.
* **HTTP Methods:** Map API endpoints to Lambda functions based on methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
* **Integration Types:**  API Gateway can proxy requests to Lambda, or integrate with other services like SNS or SQS.
* **Authorization:**  Use IAM roles, Cognito User Pools, or custom authorizers to protect your APIs. 

**DynamoDB for Serverless**

* **NoSQL Powerhouse:** Fully managed, highly scalable, key-value, and document database.
* **Pay-per-request Pricing:**  Align cost with usage patterns in serverless architectures.
* **Provisioned vs. On-Demand Capacity:** Match your throughput needs with either provisioned capacity scaling mode.
* **Design for DynamoDB:**  Understand partition keys, sort keys, and secondary indexes for efficient data modeling.

**Use Cases**

* **Web and Mobile Backends:**  Build dynamic APIs, respond to user interactions, process data.
* **Data Processing Pipelines:**  Implement event-driven architectures with Lambda functions processing S3 files, streams, and database updates.
* **IoT Workloads:** Process sensor data, trigger actions, integrate with other AWS IoT services.
* **Scheduled Tasks:** Run periodic jobs (cleanups, reports. etc.) on a schedule using Lambda.

**Key Considerations**

* **Vendor Lock-In:** Serverless often ties you closely to a specific cloud provider's services.
* **Debugging and Monitoring:**  Specialized tools are needed for distributed serverless applications.
* **State Management:** Consider external data stores or services like Step Functions if serverless functions need to maintain state across invocations.

**Tips**

* **Start with Simple Functions:** Begin with small, focused functions for easier management as you learn.
* **Take Advantage of Integrations:** The power of serverless comes from combining AWS services.
* **Embrace Asynchronous Patterns:** Serverless often leads to event-driven designs.
